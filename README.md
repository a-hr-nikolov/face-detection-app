# Face Detection App

## ðŸ‘‰[**Try it out here\***](https://a-hr-nikolov.github.io/face-detection-app/)

\***NOTE:** Server hosted on **Render.com** and kept up by a **cron-job.org** service. If the latter is down, the server will take a minute or two to restart after the initial request to it is made.

The front end of a full-stack application that integrates third party technologies both on the front and the back end.

**Back-end repo:** https://github.com/a-hr-nikolov/face-detection-app-api

## Front end built with:

- React.js + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Clarifai AI API

The current functionality includes registration, hashing, login, face detection, a simple profile and a simple database integration with PostgreSQL (check it on [the backend repo here](https://github.com/a-hr-nikolov/face-detection-app-api)).
